How does it work?

If you are seeking breastmilk donations or have breastmilk to donate,
head to the milk exchange board. You can sort by child's age and zip
code and look for attributes (e.g., soy-free diet, etc.) that match
your donation or need. You can click on user profiles and then message
them.

How do I post?

If you'd like to post a breastmilk donation or request, you can do so
on your User Dashboard.
