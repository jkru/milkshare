Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This package will allow you to get zip code information. The data used in this 
        package is retrieved from http://pablotron.org/files/zipcodes-csv-10-Aug-2004.zip
        
        pyzipcode uses a local sqlite database to run. You can replace it with your own
        other storage mechanism with a little effort.
        
        Here is some basic usage..
        
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> zipcode = zcdb[54115]
        	>>> zipcode.zip
        	u'54115'
        	>>> zipcode.city
        	u'De Pere'
        	>>> zipcode.state
        	u'WI'
        	>>> zipcode.longitude
        	-88.078959999999995
        	>>> zipcode.latitude
        	44.42042
        	>>> zipcode.timezone
        	-6
        	
        	
        Search zip codes...
        
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> len(zcdb.find_zip(city="Oshkosh"))
        	7
        	
        
        Get a list of zipcodes around a radius of a zipcode
        	
        	>>> from pyzipcode import ZipCodeDatabase
        	>>> zcdb = ZipCodeDatabase()
        	>>> [z.zip for z in zcdb.get_zipcodes_around_radius('54901', 10)]
        	[u'54901', u'54902', u'54903', u'54904', u'54906', u'54927', u'54952', u'54956', u'54957', u'54979', u'54985']
